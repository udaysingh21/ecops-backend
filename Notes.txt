SpringBoot is an open-source , Java based framework built on the top of Spring Framework , designed to simplify the development of 
standalone , production-grade spring applications.

Controller in SpringBoot are java based classes that are responsible for handling HTTP request and returning appropriate responese.

If you add SECURITY dependency then by default it will secure all HTTP endpoints and there will be a /login page asking username and password.

Entity - It is a class that maps directly to a database table
DTO (Data Transfer Objects) - It is an object which is used to transfer data b/w layers, keeps request/repsonse separate from entity logic.
Repository - It is an interface that provides CRUD operations for entities using Data JPA.
Controller - It is a RESTful endpoint handler that receives and returns data to/from external clients.
Service - This is the layer where business logic resides, co-ordinating b/w controller and repositories.
Password Encoding - A method (e.g. BCryptPasswordEncoder) which securely hash password before storing them

Entity contains all the fields that directly represents database table, including internal or sensitive data whereas DTO contains the fields that
are needed for specific request/response - tailored for what client/user sees at the end.

@Autowired - In Spring , it is used for dependency injection - it tells Spring to automatically provide/inject an instance of the required dependency at
runtime.
